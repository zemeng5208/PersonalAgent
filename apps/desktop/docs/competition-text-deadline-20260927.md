## Cause and change

Desktop submitted conversations without a timeout option. Public Client therefore
created a 10-second request deadline, which Runtime persisted as the entire
coordination task deadline. An HTTP 200 response did not imply that the workflow
body had completed in that interval.

Desktop now submits Competition conversations with a 120-second deadline through
the existing public Client option. Queries retain their 10-second default;
cancellation, Policy, tool validation, cloud routing and Local behavior are unchanged.
No automatic retry or synthetic answer is added. There is no Schema or database migration.

## Real Desktop evidence

The original application was redeployed through the official AgentArts application
deployment flow to runtime v14 (2026-09-27 11:10:40 +08:00), resolving the earlier
v13 image-pull failure. This deployment repair is separate from the Desktop deadline fix.

After restarting the repaired Desktop with its existing encrypted credentials and
history, each previously failing text was submitted once through the actual panel:

| Input | Task | Read-back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 输出99乘法表 | `9cf34fc2-d909-4cf0-9bca-9a88ab088fe2` | `succeeded`, completed `2026-09-27T03:24:44.215Z`; full table through 9×9=81 visible |
| 你现在能调用什么工具吗 | `14a8cc6d-91b1-4d81-89ee-7d2b986ab591` | `succeeded`, completed `2026-09-27T03:25:25.731Z`; answered with the published `workspace.read_text` capability |

The multiplication task deadline was `2026-09-27T03:26:28.615Z`, giving a
120-second budget. It completed in about 15.6 seconds, beyond the previous limit.
SQLite was opened read-only for these receipts. The responses retained the
`verification=unverified` marker; a capability description does not verify tool execution.

## Necessary checks and limitations

- `node --check apps/desktop/electron/main.js`: passed.
- `node --test apps/desktop/test/desktop.test.mjs apps/desktop/test/cancel.test.mjs`: 9 passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- No full test suite, additional hello loop, tool side effect or voice recording.
- SIS service activation alone is not voice acceptance; secure IAM configuration and
  actual speech acceptance are still pending. This does not complete the whole MVP.
- Longer tasks can still expire at the declared deadline; the existing generic adapter
  error can obscure timeout classification in a race. It was not relaxed in this change.
