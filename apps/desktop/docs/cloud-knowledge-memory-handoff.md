# Cloud P7 / PA020 portable handoff

Profile: `huawei_ict_agentarts`. Implementation baseline: `origin/main@7ede5f5b0072870932653df6347009ab77a35f43`.
Branch: `codex/cloud-mvp-knowledge-memory`. No auto merge.

## Preserved source

The actual deltas from `knowledge-watch-full@1ffe991` and `81fe4bce9f51620df102a5929815ba4d32409e67`
are incorporated, including the raw mapper and persistent Runtime interest intake. The complete
PA020 source chain `0e17be3 → 3d6d918 → 8433d10 → e3a0d94 → aff97747bc3a16d375137d599e6fe17b854c87bc`
is incorporated, including exact accepted-delete-before-cancel, ephemeral task/config/source-bound
memory leases, precise task stop, original erasure markers, and the application-copy erasure contract.
The initial cloud memory controller was replaced with these handed-off controllers to keep one lifecycle.

No edits to main, preload, application exports, runtime-application, history, feeds-host,
Windows writer/sidecar, knowledge-source-controls, safeStorage, userData or user databases.
`apps/runtime/src/application/memory-learning.ts` is the handed-off PA020 implementation, unchanged by
cloud-specific patches; Cloud Runtime/P8 owns its shared composition and exports.

## New delta

- P2: `taskCurrent()` rechecks original Runtime task identity, cancelRequested, failed/cancelled/cancelling,
  the real clock/deadline and operation lifecycle. It runs after every interest-reader await,
  inside the actual commit lock and inside the completed-receipt write lock. Uncertain intake remains unknown.
- A resumed/new consumer can call `recheckCurrentSource(sourceId, {deadline, signal})`, or recover through
  `refreshSubscribedFeed` after a 304. Only an exact v2 head with trusted execution provenance is reusable.
  A new consumer gets its own workKey; old unknown work is retained without resubmission. Original
  observedAt, receipt identity and validUntil remain unchanged. Stale body proof is refused.
- `current_fact` requires matching v2 receipt and original Runtime execution provenance. Missing proof
  returns `source_evidence_unavailable`; a latest observation or delivery acknowledgement is never completion.
- Non-string/null feed summaries fail normalization. Per-item quote output includes original locator,
  item/page hash, source revision, sourceId, occurredAt and fetchedAt. No new v2 receipt wire fields.
- The private lease performs the synchronous `assertCopyManagement()` gate again during final
  `assertCloudSend`, after credential waits. An asynchronous gate is rejected. A native authorization
  lease remains authorization only; it is not evidence of completed cloud consumption.
- Memory public export `createControlledMemoryReader` reads an exact user-confirmed current head,
  obtains host consent and rereads that exact head. Private/restricted cloud use needs separate
  sensitiveCloudConsent. It performs no outbound send or task dispatch.
- Learning migration 3 adds selection-stop receipts and exact-source revocation fences to the existing
  learning database. Stop does not claim a running tool stopped. Revocation never selects an older workflow.
  `stopWorkflow` and `invalidateSource` are host-only; existing precise Runtime task cancellation stays separate.
  `createEvidenceWorkflowValidator` is an optional trusted-reader adapter for exact Skill revision/hash and
  confirmed policy-allowed tool/task evidence. It does not replace the existing fixed-Skill application verifier.

## P8 / Cloud Runtime public composition

| Consumer API | Required owner-provided input / guarantee |
| --- | --- |
| `createKnowledgeWatchHost({readInterestSignal, readTrackingGrant})` | Actual native source/grant readers. Signal source proof must preserve PRIVATE unless explicitly classified PUBLIC with evidence. Neither HTTPS nor sessionAllowed is classification/consent. |
| `readTrackingGrantSnapshot({namespace, topicId, sourceId})` | Synchronous actual current grant view for answer projection. Match id/revision/expiry to the watch. Reader errors or stale grants withhold. |
| `createKnowledgeTrackingPorts({readTrackingGrant, readTrackingGrantSnapshot, layaChooser})` | Thin reader/chooser composition; no authority issuance, database, UI, sourceproof manufacture or grants. Laya is advisory; this is not AgentArts orchestration evidence. |
| `readFeedReceiptEvidence({namespace, sourceId, sourceReadTaskId, receiptId})` | Synchronous reader returning a v2 receipt rebuilt from the original confirmed execution. Root owns durable rootreceipt→actual task/run/query/scopeRef binding, not a boolean from Renderer. |
| `createKnowledgeFeedReceiptFromConfirmedExecution({namespace, sourceId, taskId, runId, toolVersion, query, scopeRef, runtime})` | New helper in knowledge-feed-receipt.ts. Uses original getTask/readToolExecutions/input digest match/tool-result checkpoint/readEvidence. Requires allow, executionStarted, confirmed, exact tool/version/query and original record accountRef/fetchedAt/classification. Returns v2 or undefined; never changes sensitivity. P8 adds the public application export. |
| `consumeInterestTask(taskId, {deadline, signal, feedCheck?})` | Actual accepted Runtime task; trusted reader alone supplies explicitEnable. Caller scope/enablement is not permission. Root dispatches this bounded consumer and preserves unknown receipts. |
| `recheckCurrentSource(sourceId, {deadline, signal})` | Trigger after resume or new consumer. Uses original receipt with independently current grant/consumer, then original Runtime workPort and judgment gates. No 304 body fabrication. |
| `prepareCoordinationGoal({taskId, conversationId, publicGoal, deadline, signal})` | P8/Cloud Runtime calls consumptionHost.prepare after acceptance and before dispatch. Persist only publicGoal and metadata binding. Return private projected goal in memory only. |
| `beforeCompetitionSend(request)` | Call consumptionHost.assertCloudSend synchronously immediately before actual send, after credential waits. Never persist projected private lease body into goal, loops, events or history. ReleaseTask on finalization/cancel; restart requires fresh native consent. |
| `createPrivateMemoryErasureHost({listBindings, cancelTask, eraseTaskCopies, readCopyErasureReceipt})` | Use the aff9774 contract. Root enumerates stable actual parent/child task bindings and owns real result/event/checkpoint/toolargs/results/derived goal/assistantHistory redaction. Active/unknown work is durably withheld. Only an exact taskId/factId/bindingDigest/purged receipt permits deleted. Missing receipt means pending, not purged. |

The actual `@personal-agent/runtime/application` exports for PA020 application functions and receipt
helpers are P8's change. Portable hosts import only existing public package exports; do not deep-import
Runtime internals from Desktop. CloudBusiness's provider proof API and P8's native feed/grant descriptor
reader can be passed through the above existing signal/receipt readers without changing the public wire protocol.

## Local unified validation (not run here)

Cloud installed dependencies once before the user switched to source-only execution. After that switch,
no unit/integration/smoke tests, build, typecheck, benchmark, inference, provider trial or screenshots ran.
Static review, JavaScript syntax-only checks and diff whitespace checks only. No passing test claim for this cloud delta.

Root compiles the integrated application/exports once in its normal local build, then runs these owned cases:

```sh
node --test --test-name-pattern='cancellation, failure or deadline during the final reader' apps/desktop/test/knowledge-watch-interest-task.test.mjs
node --test apps/desktop/test/knowledge-watch-resume-receipt.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern='confirmed execution reader|raw collect receipt' apps/runtime/test/knowledge-feed-receipt.test.mjs
node --test packages/memory/test/controlled-read.test.mjs packages/learning/test/lifecycle-evidence.test.mjs
```

Reuse the already accepted PA020/81fe evidence. Run additional integration cases only for the actual
P8 shared changes: private-native confirmation, final copy gate changes during credential wait,
exact parent/child copy purge/readback, original marker restart recovery, two consumers and v3/304,
confirmed execution mismatch, and main/Live `answer` consumption. Historic multi-citation tests that
expect current_fact without original execution proof require the genuine integrated reader; this new
gate must not be removed to make old doubles pass. No blanket whole-repository retest is requested.

## Remaining real inputs / acceptance

Root must supply actual PUBLIC source proof and native tracking grant with id/revision/expiry;
existing private feed configuration stays private. Root must register exact tool execution to source
receipt mapping and the real copy redactor/readback. Real local Skill execution, SQLite recovery,
native user consent, Windows Vault/source guards, safeStorage and main/Live integration are local acceptance.
Real AgentArts configured account/deployment/API/trace is required for cloud completion evidence;
the local advisory reevaluator is not a cloud fallback or proof. No private input or account credentials
were uploaded or used by this cloud work.

Migration 3 appends to the existing learning migration sequence; older versions retain their meaning.
Downgrading a migrated learning database to code without migration 3 is unsupported. Source fences retain
only exact source references; callers should use content-free binding identities. This does not implement
another Memory erasure system or claim erasure of backups/external copies.
