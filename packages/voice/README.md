# MOD-14 voice session foundation

This package is the provisional in-process voice-session boundary for the
`huawei_ict_agentarts` Competition Profile. It implements a push-to-talk lifecycle
with explicit Fake/Unavailable adapters. It does not choose an ASR/TTS vendor, open a
microphone, persist audio or transcripts, upload data by itself, submit Runtime tasks,
or advertise the public `voice.start` / `voice.stop` wire operations.

## Public flow

1. A trusted caller starts one bounded session with an ISO UTC deadline and an
   `AbortSignal`.
2. The caller supplies one PCM S16LE, 16 kHz, mono clip to `recognizeAudio`. The maximum
   is 60 seconds and 1,920,000 bytes. The private copy is zeroed after the adapter call.
3. Recognition returns an opaque transcript receipt. No Runtime or task action occurs.
4. The caller explicitly calls `consumeTranscript` with a restricted
   `TranscriptConsumerPort`. The stable transcript ID is also its deduplication input.
   This port may submit to a future Runtime adapter, but its stop operation only ends the
   local wait and must not call `task.cancel`.
5. A bounded reply stays private until the caller explicitly invokes `speakReply`.

`stopSpeaking`/`interrupt` stops only the current output operation and returns the
session to listening. It neither stops recognition nor changes a Runtime task. `stop`
terminates the voice session, is idempotent, aborts active operation signals, invokes
their idempotent release handles, clears in-memory transcript/reply material and reports
whether those handles released successfully. A parent cancellation or deadline does the
same with `cancelled` or `expired` state. Starting another session replaces the previous
one; late provider callbacks are discarded.

The session snapshot contains state and booleans only, never audio, transcript or reply
text. Public failures use fixed messages and do not expose provider errors. Adapters own
provider configuration, credentials, upload consent and transport. No provider is the
default: recognition and output return `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`.

## Fake use and verification

`@personal-agent/voice/testing` exports Fake recognition, explicit transcript consumer
and speech output ports. They retain only call metadata (byte/character counts, deadline,
locale and signal), not private content.

Run:

```powershell
npm.cmd run test --workspace=@personal-agent/voice
npm.cmd run typecheck --workspace=@personal-agent/voice
```

The root build now runs this workspace immediately after contracts, and the single root
lock file registers only the voice workspace/link; no external dependency was added or
upgraded. A trusted integration owner must still wire the Desktop/Runtime composition
and keep the public wire capability unavailable until production adapters and
real-device acceptance exist.
