# Huawei Cloud SIS adapter (MOD-14, Competition Profile)

Status: code-only, **unconfigured / untested / not accepted**. This adapter is a
thin, opt-in implementation of the existing `SpeechRecognitionPort` and
`SpeechOutputPort`. It does not change the default Unavailable provider or publish
the public `voice.start` / `voice.stop` wire capability.

## Trusted-host composition

The public `@personal-agent/voice` entry exports
`createHuaweiSisRecognitionPort` and `createHuaweiSisOutputPort`. A trusted host
must explicitly select one of the official supported SIS regions (`cn-north-4`
or `cn-east-3`), supply its matching project ID, and inject a
`HuaweiSisTokenPort` that provides a **SIS-scoped IAM X-Auth-Token**. The
AgentArts runtime bearer is not a SIS credential and must not be passed to
this port. No credential or environment-variable reader lives in
this package; missing configuration is an explicit error, never a local speech
fallback. Credential acquisition, refresh, storage, regional permission and
outbound-audio consent remain trusted-host responsibilities.

The ASR port sends only a caller-supplied, explicitly captured 16 kHz / 16-bit /
mono raw PCM clip (at most 60 seconds or 1,920,000 bytes) to the region's
official HTTPS `POST /v1/{project_id}/asr/short-audio`, using Base64 `data` and
`config.audio_format=pcm16k16bit`, `property=chinese_16k_general`. Only `zh-CN`
is currently mapped; other locales fail explicitly. It neither opens a
microphone nor submits a Runtime task. The host must preserve visible
push-to-talk authorization and revoke it on cancellation.

The TTS port calls `POST /v1/{project_id}/tts` only after the existing
`speakReply` flow explicitly requests output. It requests 16 kHz WAV, decodes
the bounded Base64 result and passes bytes to an injected, local
`HuaweiSisWavPlaybackPort`. This package does not open a speaker device.
The existing voice contract allows up to 8,000 characters, so the adapter
splits longer replies at Unicode code-point boundaries, preferring sentence
boundaries, into sequential requests of at most the official 500-character
limit. Each segment is a separate potentially billable SIS call; the next is
not sent until the prior local playback has completed and released. A stop or
deadline prevents remaining segments. The default voice property is
`chinese_xiaoyu_common`; a host may choose another official property for its
region. There is no automatic retry or secondary provider.

Both operations carry the caller's cancellation signal and deadline through
token resolution, HTTPS and local playback. Stops are idempotent and do not
call `task.cancel`. Provider errors and response bodies are not echoed to the
user; no audio, transcript, reply, token or full provider response is logged.
The HTTPS transport rejects redirects so its SIS token is not forwarded to a
different destination.
SIS response `trace_id` is not yet exposed because the current voice ports have
no safe receipt field for it; changing that shared interface needs separate
coordination. HTTP success would not by itself prove microphone, playback or
end-to-end task acceptance.

The factories and their types are exported from the existing package root.
`package.json` and the root lock file were not changed. Desktop composition is
owned by MOD-11 and is not changed here. No real SIS request, new recording,
build, typecheck or test was run in this code-first phase.
